       <p>This is a symbolic park named after the legend <a href="#">Chief Gani Fawehinmi</a>, A lawyer per excellence and an advocate for the common man.</p>
       <p>Today, the park service is a melting pot for all struggles emanating in the mega city (Lagos)in 2010, a park in Ojota was named after him by the <span>Lagos state goverment</span> </p>

       <p>I went to the park to take pictures for my photography assignment. I'm really proud such size of attraction was dedicated to Gani Fawehinmi.</p>
       <p>He was a man of honour and justice</p>
       <br/>
       <p>The park had beautiful sceneries,though it needs more security,because of the Ojota opportunist. It requires maintenance too. But overall I loved it</p>
